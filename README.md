# disaster_response_pipeline_project
This project develops a web app with an ETL and ML pipeline in the backend. The app trains on pre-labeled text (messages and tweets) to determine the correct naturak disaster responses required based on citizens text data. The app itself serves as an input interface to analyze and classify new text.
